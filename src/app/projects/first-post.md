This is my first post! I don't even have to touch and IDE now and I can upload content whenever.

While a developer panel would probably do the job, I like storing my markdown notes in my github repos and this way I don't have to think about
somebody stealing my credentials. Also I can just make a quick script to commit the new posts so I can work on the site and write notes without pick
and choosing my commits.
